   *
   FROM
   [dbo].[Delaware_Checkbook];
   

   ```

  - 📊 Count the total number of rows.
   ```sql
   SELECT
   COUNT(*) AS [TOTAL ROW]
   FROM
   [dbo].[Delaware_Checkbook];
  ```

- 📊 **Table Description**<br>

  ALTER COLUMN
  [FISCAL_YEAR] int;


  ALTER TABLE
  [dbo].[Delaware_Checkbook]
  ALTER COLUMN
  [FISCAL_PERIOD] int;
  
  ```


-  📊 **Check for Null Values**

  - Perform distinct counts of records for several key columns (e.g., FISCAL_YEAR, FISCAL_PERIOD, DEPT_NAME) to identify any null entries.No Null values are found


- 📊 **Remediate Data Issues**

  - Update MERCHANDISE_AMT to eliminate negative signs and round the values.
  ```sql
  SELECT
  DISTINCT [MERCHANDISE_AMT],
  COUNT(*) AS [COUNT ROWS],
  round(replace([MERCHANDISE_AMT], '-', ''), 2)
  FROM
  [dbo].[Delaware_Checkbook]
  GROUP BY
  [MERCHANDISE_AMT]
  ORDER BY
  [MERCHANDISE_AMT],
  [COUNT ROWS] ASC 
  ```


- 📊 **Create New Columns**

  - Add a new column for FISCAL_PERIOD_MONTH representing the month corresponding to the fiscal period.
  - Populate this column based on the fiscal period values.
  ```sql
  SELECT
