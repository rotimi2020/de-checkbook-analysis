<h2 id="problem_statement"> üéØ Problem Statement </h2>
The *State of Delaware Checkbook dataset* contains financial transaction data for various departments and divisions. This dataset includes key details such as the fiscal year, fiscal period, department and division names, merchant details, transaction dates, category descriptions, and transaction amounts.<br> <br>
The *primary goal* is to analyze this dataset to gain insights into financial transactions, identify spending patterns, and generate meaningful visualizations for better decision-making.

<h3 id="sections_of_the_sQL_script" > üîç Sections of the SQL Script </h3>
- üìä **View Data and Counts**<br>

  - Retrieve all records from Delaware_Checkbook.
   ```sql
   SELECT
   *
   FROM
   [dbo].[Delaware_Checkbook];
   

   ```

  - üìä Count the total number of rows.
   ```sql
   SELECT
   COUNT(*) AS [TOTAL ROW]
   FROM
   [dbo].[Delaware_Checkbook];
  ```

- üìä **Table Description**<br>

  - Execute sp_help to display the table structure and metadata.
  ```sql
  EXEC sp_help '[dbo].[Delaware_Checkbook]'
  ```

- üìä **Change Column Type**

  - Change column's data type from SMALLINT to INT.
  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE
  [dbo].[Delaware_Checkbook]
  ALTER COLUMN
  [FISCAL_YEAR] int;


  ALTER TABLE
  [dbo].[Delaware_Checkbook]
  ALTER COLUMN
  [FISCAL_PERIOD] int;
  
  ```


-  üìä **Check for Null Values**

  - Perform distinct counts of records for several key columns (e.g., FISCAL_YEAR, FISCAL_PERIOD, DEPT_NAME) to identify any null entries.No Null values are found


- üìä **Remediate Data Issues**

  - Update MERCHANDISE_AMT to eliminate negative signs and round the values.
  ```sql
  SELECT
  DISTINCT [MERCHANDISE_AMT],
  COUNT(*) AS [COUNT ROWS],
  round(replace([MERCHANDISE_AMT], '-', ''), 2)
  FROM
  [dbo].[Delaware_Checkbook]
  GROUP BY
  [MERCHANDISE_AMT]
  ORDER BY
  [MERCHANDISE_AMT],
  [COUNT ROWS] ASC 
  ```


- üìä **Create New Columns**

  - Add a new column for FISCAL_PERIOD_MONTH representing the month corresponding to the fiscal period.
  - Populate this column based on the fiscal period values.
  ```sql
  SELECT
  DISTINCT [FISCAL_PERIOD],
  CASE
    WHEN [FISCAL_PERIOD] = 7 THEN 'January'
    WHEN [FISCAL_PERIOD] = 8 THEN 'February'
    WHEN [FISCAL_PERIOD] = 9 THEN 'March'
    WHEN [FISCAL_PERIOD] = 10 THEN 'April'
    WHEN [FISCAL_PERIOD] = 11 THEN 'May'
    WHEN [FISCAL_PERIOD] = 12 THEN 'June'
    WHEN [FISCAL_PERIOD] = 1 THEN 'July'
    WHEN [FISCAL_PERIOD] = 2 THEN 'August'
    WHEN [FISCAL_PERIOD] = 3 THEN 'September'
    WHEN [FISCAL_PERIOD] = 4 THEN 'October'
    WHEN [FISCAL_PERIOD] = 5 THEN 'November'
  ELSE 'December'
  END AS [FISCAL_PERIOD]
  FROM
  [dbo].[Delaware_Checkbook];
  ```



- üìä **Create a Season Column**

  - Add another column for FISCAL_PERIOD_SEASON and populate it with the corresponding season based on month values.
  ```sql
  SELECT
  DISTINCT [FISCAL_PERIOD_MONTH],
  CASE
    WHEN [FISCAL_PERIOD_MONTH] = 'January' THEN 'Winter'
    WHEN [FISCAL_PERIOD_MONTH] = 'February' THEN 'Winter'
    WHEN [FISCAL_PERIOD_MONTH] = 'March' THEN 'Spring'
    WHEN [FISCAL_PERIOD_MONTH] = 'April' THEN 'Spring'
    WHEN [FISCAL_PERIOD_MONTH] = 'May' THEN 'Spring'

    WHEN [FISCAL_PERIOD_MONTH] = 'November' THEN 'Fall'
    WHEN [FISCAL_PERIOD_MONTH] = 'December' THEN 'Winter'
  ELSE [FISCAL_PERIOD_MONTH]
  END AS season
  FROM
  [dbo].[Delaware_Checkbook];
  ```



- üìä **Check for Duplicates**<br>

  - Select duplicates for review.
  ```sql
  WITH
  DupRows AS (
    SELECT
      *,
      ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
        PARTITION BY [FISCAL_YEAR],

    FROM
      [dbo].[Delaware_Checkbook]
  )
  SELECT
  *
  FROM
  DupRows
  WHERE
  row_num > 1 
  ```


- üìä **Remove Duplicate Rows**

  - Another CTE to find duplicates, followed by deleting them from the table.
  ```sql
  WITH
  DupRows AS (
  SELECT
  *,
  ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
        PARTITION BY [FISCAL_YEAR],
        [FISCAL_PERIOD],
